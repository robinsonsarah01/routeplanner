routeplanner
============

CS334 AI final project - plan routes depending on features (Mount Holyoke College)

To test the routeplanner:

* clone the project locally
* make sure you have Python with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) installed
* run `python app.py`; the site will be up at localhost:5000, as is default
* if the map doesn't show up, you may need to generate a new Google Maps API key at the [Google developers console](https://console.developers.google.com)
