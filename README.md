routeplanner
============

CS334 AI final project, Fall 2014 - plan routes depending on features (Mount Holyoke College)

There's a demo of this project [on youtube](http://youtu.be/Kz90bZeNiqg)!

To test the routeplanner yourself:

* clone the project locally
* make sure you have Python with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) installed
* run `python app.py` from the project root; the site will be up at localhost:5000, as is default
* if the map doesn't show up, you may need to generate a new Google Maps API key at the [Google developers console](https://console.developers.google.com) and add it to the templates/home.html file (on line 18, where `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY` appears)
